                  <h2>Many moons ago...</h2>
                  <p class="lead">The year was 1997. A 7 year old Lenny stood in front of her grade 2 class, about to sing Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” for show and tell. As she pressed play on the in-house boombox, she was overcome with nerves. How can I possibly perform to my full potential with their tiny, judgemental faces staring at me? So, with sound mind and logic, she requested that every student turned their back to her and faced the wall instead. They complied respectfully, and her racing heart slowed. 
                     She sang the song as though it was her who was a fancy lady in furs on a boat. <br>
                     The song was done and she had just completed her first major performance. It’s not so bad like this, she thought. I think I’ll do it forever.

                     "Beneath a gentle, good-humoured exterior lies a melancholy darkness that emerges softly from her lyrics and tone. Lenny's descriptive songs and enticing voice captivates audiences, as she paints a picture so vivid you can’t help but see yourself within it; bridging the current to some distant memory in your own life." - Everyone
